### Water Powered City(Ergonomic City)

What is a better, more efficient, environment-friendly power source?

The Earth is my client. THe Earth's problem is that its dying due to global warming. The leading cause of global warming is fossil fuels which can easily be resolved. My solution is that I will create a water powered super-mill that will power a city's housing units and train system.

### Scenario:

  I chose two clients, both of which are students who ride the MTA trains almost daily. Almost every morning, they seem to have some sort of complaint about their commute that morning. Also, these two students are also invested in the environment, and they would like to prevent our planet dying at the hands of Global Warming. So, I proposed a city, powered by a water mill, that uses electricity to power the city’s train system. The train system doesn’t allow for failure because similar to the MTA’s current train system, the trains aren’t physically allowed to leave the station. However, the reason why this project is more advanced and won’t fail is because there is no space for human error. Most of the MTA’s problems are based on a conductor stepping out of line, or they might stop or go at the wrong time. Through this efficient train system, the train cars will know exactly when to move and when to stop. In addition, these cars will be powered by the water mill through an arduino controller, where all the code and signal connections will be stored. Also, there will be houses, with  LEDS in them that are also powered by the water mill. The LEDs only portray a certain amount of light based on the time of day in the real world. Using the PWM(Pulse Width Modulation), the lights can range from the values 1 - 255, so they will be brighter towards the night time, but at a certain time they will turn off until the morning again. Finally, the water mill will be created by attaching a 12V motor onto a mill that spins when water is poured onto it. On another note, the advisor that I picked for this project is my CompSci teacher, Tristan, because they are the only person who can advise my project because no other adults in my life would really understand the project and wouldn’t be able to discuss it with me.
