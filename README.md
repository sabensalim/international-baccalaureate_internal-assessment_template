### Scenario:

  I chose three clients, all of which seem to have the problem of managing their time wisely. These three students, Zack, Henry and Renato, all play sports after school and get home late. They seem to find themselves in the dilemma of a large amount of homework and little time to do it. After discussing my project with the three of them, they all seemed to agree with me that a program that allowed them to prioritize which work to do, would help them because they would be able to get into the habit of what to prioritize and not to procrastinate. The advisor that I picked for this project is my CompSci teacher, Tristan, because they are the only person who can advise my project because no other adults in my life would really understand the project and wouldn’t be able to discuss it with me. My proposed product is a website application that takes in what homework a student has, and the student has the ability to insert what extracurriculars they might have. From there, the application determines what homework the student should do at which time. Also, the application will be able to shut out any websites that might be distracting, and the student can choose which websites may be distracting.
